\section{Protocol}
Client must create a secure communication channel to connect to the server.
% TODO more details on next lessons

A \texttt{parola} is defined as a pure ASCII sequence which can match the following regular expression \texttt{[A-Za-z0-9\textbackslash.\_]*}.
Different \texttt{parola}s can be separed by a whitespace.

\subsection{Request commands}
A request command is sent by the client to the server.

Generic structure of a request command is:
\begin{verbatim}
COMM filename\n
tag: value\n
\n
body
\end{verbatim}

Each line is terminated by a \texttt{LF} char, and each command is terminated by a \texttt{LF} char.
It is important to send the line feed char because server will not parse the command until two trailing \texttt{LF}s are received.

Note: a \texttt{LF} char is represented by a byte whose value is \texttt{0x0A}.
\\
A command is composed by the following parts:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{COMM} is a 4 char \texttt{parola} and represents the command to issue;
  \item \texttt{filename} is the name of a file on which issue the command.
  Filenames are composed by one \texttt{parola}.
  Depending on the specific command, a filename is mandatory or forbidden;
  \item \texttt{tag: value} is a pair of two \texttt{parola}s, composed by a \texttt{parola} immediately followed by a colon, a whitespace and another \texttt{parola}.
  First \texttt{parola} represents the tag for an additional parameter of current command, while second one representes the actual value for the parameter; depending on the specific command, one or more parameters may be mandatory or forbidden;
  \item \texttt{body} is a stream of bytes whose length must be specified in a command parameter; depending on the specific command, a body is mandatory or forbidden:
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reply status}
A reply status is sent by the server to the client.

Generic structure of a reply status is:

\begin{verbatim}
DDD\n
tag: value
\n
body
\end{verbatim}

A reply status is composed by the following parts:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{DDD} a 3 ASCII digits number representing the state of the previous request command;
  \item \texttt{tag: value} is a pair to represent a parameter, with the same format of the request command parameter; depending on the specific command, one or more parameters may be mandatory or forbidden;
  \item \texttt{body} is a stream of bytes whose length must be specified in a reply status parameter; depending on the specific command the reply refers to, a body is mandatory or forbidden;
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Request commands list}
\subsubsection{ALLO}
\texttt{ALLO filename}

Request server to allocate a file called \emph{filename}.
This command is useful to atomically:
\begin{itemize}
  \item test if a file exists on the remote server
  \item create that file
\end{itemize}
and must be used before issuing a \texttt{STOR} command.

Reply status:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{200}: ok
  \item \texttt{201}: ok, file already exists
  \item \texttt{452}: bad file
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{DELE}
\texttt{DELE filename}

Reply status:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{200}: ok
  \item \texttt{452}: bad file
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{LIST}
\texttt{LIST}

Request the server to send a list of available files

Reply status:
\begin{verbatim}
200\n
Size: listsize\n
\n
body
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{body} is a list of \texttt{parola}, each one representing the name of a file and each one separed by a newline.

\subsubsection{QUIT}
\texttt{QUIT}

Close connection with the server.

Reply status:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{200}: ok
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{RETR}
\texttt{RETR filename}

Retrieve a file from the server.

Reply status:
\begin{itemize}
  \item success:
\begin{verbatim}
200\n
Size: filesize\n
\n
body
\end{verbatim}
  \item failure:\\
  \texttt{452}: bad file
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{STOR}
\begin{verbatim}
STOR filename
Size: filesize

body
\end{verbatim}

Store a file on the remote server.
This command can be issued only after an \texttt{ALLO} command.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{Size: filesize} is a parameter pair. \texttt{filesize} is the decimal ASCII representation of the file size in bytes;
  \item \texttt{body} is the actual content of the file;
\end{itemize}

Reply status:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{200}: ok
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Generic return values}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{501}: syntax error
  \item \texttt{502}: command not implemented
  \item \texttt{503}: bad sequence of commands
\end{itemize}
